* This is the project that I've worked as a Freelancer Data Scientist. I did the pre-processing steps for this dataset: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income

* I wrote the code in a generic way. So for exapple they can use the "pd_normalize_quantile" function (Find IQR and implement to numerical and sparse columns separately) for any dataset in their systems.
